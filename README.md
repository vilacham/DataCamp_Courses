# DataCamp_Courses
This repository contains jupyter notebooks of DataCamp courses. 
On branch master I keep directories with files of courses I've already completed.
The courses I've started are in different branches, and will be merged only when I complete them.

## Completed
* Intro to Python for Data Science: Python basics, Python lists, functions, packages, NumPy
